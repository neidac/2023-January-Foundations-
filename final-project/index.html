                            Welcome to Whisker Cafe - the ultimate destination for cat lovers and coffee
                            enthusiasts! Our cafe offers a cozy atmosphere and a variety of delicious
                            coffee and tea beverages, as well as fresh pastries and snacks. Our resident
                            cats are available for adoption, and we partner with local animal shelters
                            to provide them with the best care. We believe in giving back to the community
                            and donate a portion of our profits to local animal shelters and rescue organizations.
                            Visit us today and enjoy a cup of coffee with our furry friends!

                        <p>
                            Our adoption process is designed to ensure that our cats are placed in loving and caring
                            homes. If you want to adopt one of our cats, fill out an adoption application. Our team 
                            will review your application and contact you to schedule a meet and greet with the cat 
                            of your choice. During your visit, you can spend time with the cat, ask questions, and 
                            get to know its unique personality. If you feel a connection with the cat, we will work 
                            with you to complete the adoption process. We believe that every cat deserves a loving 
                            home, and we are committed to helping our cats find their forever families. If you're 
                            interested in adopting one of our cats, simply click the "Adopt Now" button on our

                    <h1>Requirements</h1>
                    <p>
                        To ensure the safety and well-being of our feline residents and the enjoyment of our visitors, we kindly ask that
                        all visitors to our cat cafe comply with the following requirements:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Sanitize your hands upon entering the cafe: This helps keep the environment clean and free of germs, which is especially important for the health of our cats.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Remove your shoes: This helps keep the floors and furniture clean, as well as prevents outdoor dirt and germs from being brought into the cafe.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Refrain from disturbing the cats while they're sleeping or eating: Our cats need their rest and privacy, and may become agitated or aggressive if disturbed during these times.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Avoid any behaviors that could make the cats feel uncomfortable or threatened: This includes sudden movements, loud noises, or invading their personal space.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do not feed the cats: We provide food and treats for our feline residents, and giving them additional food can disrupt their diets and cause health issues.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do not pick up or carry the cats: Our cats are free to roam and interact with visitors on their own terms, and may become scared or agitated if picked up or carried.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Be gentle and respectful with the cats: This includes petting them gently and following their cues for interaction, as well as refraining from any rough play or handling.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        By following these requirements, we can ensure that our cats are happy and healthy, and that all visitors have a fun and enjoyable experience at our cat cafe. Thank you for your cooperation!

                    <p>
                        We believe that every cat deserves a loving family and a warm home, and we are proud to be a part of that mission.
                        Our adoptable cats are fully vetted and up-to-date on their vaccinations, and they receive the same level of care 
                        and attention as our resident cats. We work closely with the shelters to ensure that each cat is matched with 
                        the right family, and we provide a comfortable and safe environment for potential adopters to get to know the 
                        cats. Adopting a cat is a rewarding experience, and we encourage our visitors to consider giving a cat a loving 
                        home. We are always excited to see one of our adoptable cats find their forever family, and we celebrate each 
                        successful adoption with joy and gratitude.
