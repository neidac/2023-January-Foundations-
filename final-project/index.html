                    <h1>Requirements</h1>
                    <p>
                        To ensure the safety and well-being of our feline residents and the enjoyment of our visitors, we kindly ask that
                        all visitors to our cat cafe comply with the following requirements:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Sanitize your hands upon entering the cafe: This helps keep the environment clean and free of germs, which is especially important for the health of our cats.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Remove your shoes: This helps keep the floors and furniture clean, as well as prevents outdoor dirt and germs from being brought into the cafe.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Refrain from disturbing the cats while they're sleeping or eating: Our cats need their rest and privacy, and may become agitated or aggressive if disturbed during these times.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Avoid any behaviors that could make the cats feel uncomfortable or threatened: This includes sudden movements, loud noises, or invading their personal space.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do not feed the cats: We provide food and treats for our feline residents, and giving them additional food can disrupt their diets and cause health issues.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do not pick up or carry the cats: Our cats are free to roam and interact with visitors on their own terms, and may become scared or agitated if picked up or carried.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Be gentle and respectful with the cats: This includes petting them gently and following their cues for interaction, as well as refraining from any rough play or handling.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        By following these requirements, we can ensure that our cats are happy and healthy, and that all visitors have a fun and enjoyable experience at our cat cafe. Thank you for your cooperation!

                        <p>
                            We believe that every cat deserves a loving family and a warm home, and we are proud to be a part of that mission.
                            Our adoptable cats are fully vetted and up-to-date on their vaccinations, and they receive the same level of care 
                            and attention as our resident cats. We work closely with the shelters to ensure that each cat is matched with 
                            the right family, and we provide a comfortable and safe environment for potential adopters to get to know the 
                            cats. Adopting a cat is a rewarding experience, and we encourage our visitors to consider giving a cat a loving 
                            home. We are always excited to see one of our adoptable cats find their forever family, and we celebrate each 
                            successful adoption with joy and gratitude.

                                Dinky is an adorable orange cat with crossed eyes who is currently up for adoption. With his unique appearance,
                                he has a silly and playful personality that makes him an absolute joy to be around. Dinky loves to chase after toys,
                                climb on furniture, and cuddle up with his favorite humans. His quirky looks only add to his charm, and he's sure
                                to win the hearts of anyone who meets him. If you're looking for a feline companion who's as entertaining as he is 
                                lovable, Dinky is the perfect choice

                                While Gizmo may appear calm and gentle, it's worth noting that he can be a little feisty at times.
                                This is because Gizmo was once a feral cat and had to learn how to fend for himself on the streets.
                                However, with patience and love from his caregivers, Gizmo has come a long way and is now a loving
                                and loyal companion. He may still have some remnants of his feral past, but with the right family, 
                                he is sure to flourish and become an even more wonderful pet. If you're willing to provide Gizmo with 
                                the love and patience he deserves, he'll reward you with endless affection and companionship.
