            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Twin brothers Kent & Kevin Smotherman founded TwinFeats Software in 1983 with 
                a simple premise: Free Software for a free world. From the beginnings on the Commodare 64 
                to today's android apps, vision has never wavered.

                        dozen programming languages. He enjoys teaching web development, chess, and

            <h1>Services</h1>
            <p>TwinFeats Software created innovative, custom web applications which will meet and exceed expectations.
                 We will work with you to fully understand your needs, but more than that - your data. Web applications 
                 are all about data, and without deeply understanding the needs of your data, your web application will suffer.
            </p>
            <h2>Web application? Huh?</h2>
            <p>Web sites are static. The content they display doesn't change dynamically. A web application is a web site powered by a database.
                Facebook is a great example of a web application - the data shown caries by used and can change every single second.

                We've written so many applications in the last 35+ years that we have literally lost count! Applications like our FreedomWare line
                of games for the Commodore 64 are long gone, as are our productivity suite for GEOS on the C64 and Amiga 
            </p>
            <p>
                Ever use Webex, GotoMeeting, or Zoom teleconferencing software? We wrote our own back in the 90s just conferencing but online
                    learning our Android applications range from custom games to productivity tools. Web sites and web applications? We've done 'em by the dozens

                As we like to say, if we can't do it at TwinFeats Software, its a hardware problem!
